# Introduction

Welcome to the Publitas public API documentation. This API can be used to programatically list your account's groups, as well as to list and create publications based on existing PDF documents.

### Version

Our API is currently on version 2. Click [here](v1.html) to see documentation for the first version of the API.

### Authentication

Our public API requires an API key, sent with the parameter `api_key`. This can be generated by visiting your user settings page. For convenience, we also allow HTTP based authorization with the `api` user and your API key as password.

### Formats

Currently we only support JSON requests.

### Paths

The base path of an API request is: `https://api.publitas.com/v2/`

An example of a complete path is:

`https://api.publitas.com/v2/groups/?api_key=<api_key>`

# Groups

```shell
# This will retrieve all the groups accessible by the user
curl "https://api.publitas.com/v2/groups?api_key=<api_key>"
```
> The above command returns a JSON document structured like so:

```json
{
    "groups": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Sprockets",
            "slug": "sprockets",
            "url": "https://api.publitas.com/v2/groups/1",
            "publications_url": "https://api.publitas.com/v2/groups/1/publications",
            "publication_count": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

The attributes are as follows:

|       Field       |   Type  |                    Description                    |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| id                | Integer | Group ID                                          |
| title             | String  | Group title                                       |
| slug              | String  | Group slug                                        |
| url               | String  | Group details URL                                 |
| publications_url  | String  | Publication list URL for the group                |
| publication_count | Integer | Amount of publications contained within the group |

# Publications

## Listing

}
```

The following fields need to be sent within a publication scope (see right for an example.)

|         Name        |   Type   | Required |                                                                               Description                                                                                |

| slug                | String   | No       | The slug for the publication (when not present it will be derived from the title)                                                                                        |
| language            | String   | No       | 2-digit language code. See [the language table](#languages) below for allowed values                                                                                     |
| schedule_online_at  | DateTime | No       | Time at which the publication is scheduled to be online. If the current time (or a past time) is provided, the publication will be put online as soon as it is converted |

| source_url          | String   | Yes      | URL where the PDF file resides. HTTP and HTTPS are accepted, and it needs to be a public accessible file.                                                                |

When created, a publication is automatically queued to be converted. The conversion status can be monitored by requesting the URL that you find in the `url` key.

For a publication created via the API, the state path should be `new` > `downloading` > `waiting` > `offline`
